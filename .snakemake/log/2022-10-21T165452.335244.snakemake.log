Job 1: 
        Refining tree
          - estimate timetree
          - use opt coalescent timescale
          - estimate marginal node dates
          - filter tips more than 4 IQDs from clock expectation
        
Reason: Missing output files: results/branch_lengths.json, results/tree.nwk; Input files updated by another job: results/aligned.fasta, results/tree_raw.nwk; Params have changed since last execution

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
