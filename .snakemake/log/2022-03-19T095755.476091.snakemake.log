Job 1: 
        Refining tree
          - estimate timetree
          - use opt coalescent timescale
          - estimate marginal node dates

Error in rule refine:

    shell:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job refine since they might be corrupted:
results/tree.nwk, results/branch_lengths.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
