Job 3: 
        Aligning sequences to config/reference.gb
          - filling gaps with N
        

[Mon Feb 14 15:24:10 2022]
Error in rule align:
    jobid: 3
    output: results/aligned.fasta
    shell:
        
        augur align             --sequences results/filtered.fasta             --reference-sequence config/reference.gb             --output results/aligned.fasta             --fill-gaps
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job align since they might be corrupted:
results/aligned.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
