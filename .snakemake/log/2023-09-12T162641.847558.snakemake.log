Job 1: 
        Refining tree
          - estimate timetree
          - use opt coalescent timescale
          - estimate marginal node dates
          - filter tips more than 100 IQDs from clock expectation
        
Reason: Missing output files: results/tree.nwk, results/branch_lengths.json; Input files updated by another job: results/tree_raw.nwk

[Tue Sep 12 16:26:53 2023]
Error in rule refine:
    jobid: 1
    input: results/tree_raw.nwk, results/aligned.fasta, data/metadata.csv
    output: results/tree.nwk, results/branch_lengths.json
    shell:
        
        augur refine             --tree results/tree_raw.nwk             --alignment results/aligned.fasta             --metadata data/metadata.csv             --output-tree results/tree.nwk             --output-node-data results/branch_lengths.json             --timetree             --coalescent opt             --date-confidence             --date-inference marginal             --clock-filter-iqd 100

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job refine since they might be corrupted:
results/tree.nwk, results/branch_lengths.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
