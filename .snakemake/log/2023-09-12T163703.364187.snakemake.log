Job 1: 
        Refining tree
          - estimate timetree
          - use opt coalescent timescale
          - estimate marginal node dates
          - filter tips more than 4 IQDs from clock expectation
        
Reason: Missing output files: results/branch_lengths.json, results/tree.nwk

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule refine in file /Users/user/Programming Directory/Ebel Lab/WNV-Foco-nextstrain2/Snakefile, line 78:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/tree.nwk
results/branch_lengths.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
